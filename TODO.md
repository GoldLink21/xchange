- [ ] Large form macros (@define vs @def)
    - Allows defining macros with NLs in it
- [ ] Allow newline skipping in macro args
- [X] Allow spaces in macro args. Resolve them as listed
- [ ] Fix macro expansion in macro defs
- [ ] Instead of erroring out, return false in parseText()
- [ ] Maybe allow defining macro names using macros
    - Could use @def (macro name) (args, args, ...) body
    - The name would get checked that it has no \r\n or whitespace
    - Or, allow it and allow @(macro name)(args, args, ...) calls
